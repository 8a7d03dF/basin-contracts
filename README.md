# Basin Finance â€“ a fork of BAO Markets (a.k.a. HardSynths)

For those who want to dive into the protocol early we recommend familiarizing yourself with the compound protocol:

https://compound.finance/docs (Excellent documentation)

and after that Inverse Finance:

https://github.com/InverseFinance/anchor

The specific configurations and changes made to the protocol can be viewed in the Bao Docs:

https://docs.bao.finance/franchises/bao-markets

As part of Basin, we've made further changes to contracts/InverseFinance/Oracle.sol where there's a keeper role that can set the fixed price of any cToken, which we plan on doing in a 5 minute cadence to account for the (current) lack of Oracles on base.

This role can be deprecated later by setting the keeper to the 0 address.
